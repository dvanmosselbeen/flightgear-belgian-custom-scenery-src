## 3D objects coming from another source:

This is a list of the generic objects that come from another sources with eventually a description of the changes as applied to the object. 

| Object Path | Source | Author | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| Generic_Objects/Airport/Vehicles/hoskosh-ti-1500 | TerraSync | ... | Optimized the object. Merged all these 13 pieces together into 2 objects (left the water canon as a separated object in case of wishes to animated that).|
| Generic_Objects/StreetFurniture/streetlight_yellow_pillar.ac | Is mine i think | ... |
| Generic_Objects/Trees/lime_large_sq | Unknown (probably TerraSync) | ... | Adjusted some stuff to it but i don't recall what precisely.|
| Generic_Objects/Military/humvee-pickup-odrab-lowres | TerraSync | ... | Optimized the object. Joined all 14 objects into one object and removed doubles. |
