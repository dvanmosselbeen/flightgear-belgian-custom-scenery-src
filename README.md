This repository contains the source files of the **[flightgear-belgian-custom-scenery repository](https://github.com/dvanmosselbeen/flightgear-belgian-custom-scenery)**. This include all the Blend and all source files which helped to created the FGFS Belgium scenery.

This repository is not for the average user but is destinated to all peoples who want to contribute on the Belgian FlightGear Flight Simulator Scenery.

You can find more information on the dedicated wiki page for the "source" version. This is another wiki than the one for the scenery itself; See: https://github.com/dvanmosselbeen/flightgear-belgian-custom-scenery-src/wiki

*Actually this repository doesn't contains **all** the source files yet. Almost all files are included in this repo and more is coming each day. The issue is that many of the blend files where created with Blender version 2.4x and they need to be migrated to version 2.79. Idem with the Inkscape files. So atm i'm checking each file one at a time by hand, fixing up little migration glitches. This just suck, but that's life...*
