# WELCOME TO THIS REPOSITORY :)

This repository contains the source files of the
**[flightgear-belgian-custom-scenery repository](https://github.com/dvanmosselbeen/flightgear-belgian-custom-scenery)**. This include all the
Blend and all source files which helped to created the FGFS Belgium scenery.

This repository is not for the average user but is destinated to all peoples
who want to contribute on the Belgian FlightGear Flight Simulator Scenery.

You can find more information on the dedicated wiki page for the "source" version. This is another wiki than the one for the scenery itself; See:
https://github.com/dvanmosselbeen/flightgear-belgian-custom-scenery-src/wiki

*Actually this repository doesn't contains all the source files yet. The issue is that many of the blend files where created with Blender version 2.4x and they need to be migrated to version 2.79. Idem with the Inkscape files. So atm i'm checking each file by hand, fixing up little migration glitches.*

# APPLICATIONS USED TO CREATE THIS SCENERY

We only used open source software and **FREE** resources to create this
scenery. There's no requirements to use the same tools, even if it would help a
lot.

 * Blender
 * Gimp
 * Inkscape
 * Python
